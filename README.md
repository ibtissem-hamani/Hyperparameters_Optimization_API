# Hyperparameters_Optimization_APP
Most supervised classification algorithms have hyper parameters (the parameters of the algorithm) for example the number k of neighbors in the KNN that must be fixed, they play a very important role in the evaluation of the classification, so we are looking for a technique for optimization by ensuring that the model does not suffer from overfitting which is a problem caused by incorrect sizing of the structure used to classify.
